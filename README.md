# Visualise Data Structures in C Terminal

A terminal-based application written in C to **visualize common data structures** such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. This project helps learners understand how these data structures work by showing their state and operations step-by-step directly in the terminal.

## Features

- Visual representation of fundamental data structures  
- Interactive commands to perform operations (insert, delete, traverse, etc.)  
- Clear and intuitive terminal output  
- Written purely in C with no external dependencies  
- Great tool for beginners learning data structures and algorithms

## Supported Data Structures

- Arrays  
- Singly Linked Lists  
- Doubly Linked Lists  
- Stacks  
- Queues  
- Binary Trees  
- Graphs (basic representation)
